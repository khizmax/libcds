Building library with CMake
===============

CDS suports both in-source and out-of-source cmake build types. Now project uses:

- CMake: general cross-platform building
- CTest: all unit tests can be run in a standard way by *ctest* command
- CPack: for making rpm/deb/nsys etc. packages

Compiling and testing
----------
**Building out-of-source in "RELEASE" mode ("DEBUG" is default)**

- Wherever create empty directory for building, for instance `libcds-debug`
- Prepare: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE <path to the project's root directory with CMakeLists.txt>`
- Compile: `make -j4`
- As a result you'll see shared and static cds libraries in the build directory

**Warning**: We strongly recommend not to use static cds library. Static library is not tested and not maintained. You can use it on own risk.

After using command cmake -L <path to the project's root directory with CMakeLists.txt> one can see some additional variables, that can activate additional features:

- `LIBCDS_WITH_TESTS:BOOL=OFF`: if you want to build library with unit testing support use *-DLIBCDS_WITH_TESTS=ON* on prepare step. Be careful with this flag, because compile time will dramatically increase
- `LIBCDS_WITH_TESTS_COVERAGE:BOOL=OFF`: Analyze test coverage using gcov (only for gcc)
- `LIBCDS_WITH_BOOST_ATOMIC:BOOL=OFF`: Use boost atomics (only for boost >= 1.54)
- `LIBCDS_WITH_ASAN:BOOL=OFF`: compile libcds with AddressSanitizer instrumentation
- `LIBCDS_WITH_TSAN:BOOL=OFF`: compile libcds with ThreadSanitizer instrumentation

Additional gtest hints (for unit and stress tests only):
- `GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS=path`: gives full `path` to gtest include dir. 
- `GTEST_LIBRARY=path`: gives full `path` to `libgtest.a`.


Packaging
----------

In order to package library *CPack* is used, command *cpack -G <Generator>* should create correspondent packages for particular operating system. Now the project supports building the following package types:

- *RPM*: redhat-based linux distribs        
- *DEB*: debian-based linux distribs
- *TGZ*: simple "*tgz*" archive with library and headers
- *NSYS*: windows installer package (NSYS should be installed)   
  
"Live" building and packaging example
----------
- `git clone https://github.com/khizmax/libcds.git`
- `mkdir libcds-release`
- `cd libcds-release`
- `cmake -DWITH_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ../libcds`
```
