CDS (Concurrent Data Structures) C++ library

CDS library is (mostly) header-only template library. The shared library contains only garbage collector's core implementation.

Supported compilers
---------------------------------

GCC: 4.8 and above
MS Visual C++: 12 (2013) and above
Clang: 3.3 and above

How to build
------------

The CDS library is depend on boost header-only libraries (tested with boost 1.47 and later). 
The regression tests in tests directory also depends on boost_thread dynamic library. 
You should build boost_thread library before building CDS test.

Windows
    Use Visual C++ 2013 solution projects\Win\vc12\cds.sln.
    The solution depends on BOOST_PATH environment variable that contains the path to boost root directory. 
    The CDS tests also depends on boost_thread library in %BOOST_PATH%\stage\lib or %BOOST_PATH%\bin.

Unix 
    GCC compiler supported (4.8 and above) and Clang 3.3 and above for Linux
    Use script build/build.sh that builds release and debug libcds.so and tests executable. Please,
    do not try to call 'make' directly, - build.sh script sets necessary vars for make.
    See examples in build/sample directory.

    build.sh main options:
    -x compiler     C++ compiler name (g++, gcc, clang; default g++)
    -p arch         Processor architecture. Possible values are:  x86, amd64, x86_64, sparc, ia64
    -o os_family    OS family. Possible values are: linux, sunos, solaris, hpux
    -b bits         Bits to build (32 or 64)
    -l options      Extra linker options
    -x options      Extra compiler options
    --with-boost path   Path to boost root
    --clean         Clean all before building

    For more options use build.sh -h

Warnings
    GCC: compile CDS library and all projects that depends on libcds with -fno-strict-aliasing flag!
    
Test suite
----------
    Note the duration of full test set is up to 24 hours (depending on your hardware and test configuration)
