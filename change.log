2.1.0
    - cds::lock namespace is renamed to cds::sync. All classes defined in cds::lock namespace 
      are moved to cds::sync with new names (for example, cds::lock::SpinLock is renamed to
      cds::sync::spin_lock). cds::lock namespace and its contents is deprecated and it is kept 
      for backward compatibility.

2.0.0 30.12.2014
    General release
    - the library has been rewritten to support at least C++11. Compilers: GCC 4.8+, clang 3.3+, 
      MS Visual C++ 12 (2013) Update 4 an above.
    - Removed: MichaelDeque, reason: the implementation is heavy-weighted, inefficient,
      and, seems, unstable.
    - Removed: cds::gc::HRC garbage collector, reason: the implementation is inefficient 
      and unstable.
    - Changed: all container's declaration except StripedSet has been unified to the
      following traits-based form: 
           class Container< GC, T, Traits >
    - Added: new member function pop_with(Func) to cds::container::TreiberStack
    - Added: new member functions enqueue_with(Func), dequeue_with(Func) to 
             cds::container::MSQueue
             cds::container::MoirQueue
             cds::container::BasketQueue

    - Added: new member functions push_with(Func) and pop_with(Func) to cds::container::MSPriorityQueue
    - SegmentedQueue: add padding into segmented_queue::traits to eliminate false sharing.
    - Changed: guarded_ptr and exempt_ptr have move semantics now. The container's extract() and get()
      member functions return the objects of that type.
    - Changed: improved cds::gc::HP and cds::gc::DHP internal implementation
    - Changed: map member function insert_key() has been renamed to insert_with()
    - Changed: cds/cxx11_atomic.h has been renamed to cds/algo/atomic.h
    - Removed: cds/refcounter.h

1.6.0 23.09.2014

    - Add flat combining (FC) technique and FC-based containers: FCStack, FCQueue, 
      FCDeque, FCPriorityQueue
    - Add elimination back-off feature to TreiberStack class
    - Add SegmentedQueue - an unfair queue implementation
    - New member functions for sets and maps:
      Functions get() and get_with() search a key and return the pointer to item found 
      in safe manner.
      Function extract() searches a key, unlinks the item found from the container 
      and returns pointer to item in safe manner.
      The functions get, get_with, extract, extract_with extract_min, extract_max 
      has been added to the following container:
        SkipListSet, SkipListMap
        EllenBinTree, EllenBinTreeSet, EllenBinTreeMap
      The functions get, get_with, extract, extract_with has been added

    - Fix a bug in BasketQueue
    - Fix EllenBinTree crash under high contention
    - Changed: the thread manager detach order to prevent crashing of signal-handled RCU
      in some case.
    - Changed: cds::gc::HP calls Scan() when a thread is detached.
      This prevents accumulating retired data.
    - Changed: minimal boost version is 1.51
    - Removed: file cds/lock/rwlock.h

1.5.0 29.12.2013
    General release
    1. Added: EllenBinTree - an implementation of unbalanced binary search
      tree based on paper [2010] F.Ellen, P.Fatourou, E.Ruppert, F.van Breugel 
      "Non-blocking Binary Search Tree".
    2. Added: MSPriorityQueue - an array-based lock-based priority queue heap, 
      see [1996] G.Hunt, M.Michael, S. Parthasarathy, M.Scott "An efficient 
      algorithm for concurrent priority queue heaps"
    3. Added support for boost.atomic for boost 1.54 and above. 
      Now, libcds supports processor architecture like ARM, PowerPC and any other
      that are supported by boost.atomic or by C++11 compiler. Any feedbacks are appreciated.
      To use boost.atomic you should specify -DCDS_USE_BOOST_ATOMIC in compiler's command line.
    4. Added: a new CDS_USE_LIBCDS_ATOMIC preprocessor flag has been added to direct
      the compiler to use libcds atomic unconditionally.
    5. build.sh has been modified to relax processor architecture and OS requirements. 
      This allows to use libcds with native compiler atomic support (or boost.atomic) 
      for a processor architecture that has not been tested by libcds's developers.
    6. Added support for CLang 3.3
    7. Added support for MS VC++ 2013
    8. Added support for Mac OS X, see build/sample/build-osx-clang-libc++.sh, 
      build/sample/build-osx-gcc.sh for example.
    9. Fixed: SkipListSet::erase_with does not take into account "less" predicate parameter.
    10.Fixed: some bugs in SkipListSet leading to deadloop
    11.Fixed: MichaelMap bug: computing hash value for type Q different from key type.

1.4.0 20.05.2013
    General release
    1. Added: user-space RCU garbage collector (5 different implementations), 
       see cds::urcu namespace
    2. Added: RCU-related set/map container specializations
    3. Added: Skip-list specialization for cds::gc::nogc (undeletable skip-list)
    4. For set/map classes: find_with and erase_with member functions have been added.
       These functions allow to use different predicates for searching.
    5. Added: threading model based on Ñ++11 thread_local keyword (CDS_THREADING_CXX11).
       At present, only gcc 4.8 supports such model.
    6. Fixed: bug #11 "ABA bug in libcds 1.3.1 cds/intrusive/msqueue.h"
       Thanks to Jelle van den Hooff.
    7. Added support for GCC 4.8

1.3.1 27.01.2013
    Bugfix release
    - Bug fixed: building libcds with boost versions before 1.48
      Thanks Lucas Larsch who points me to this problem.
  
1.3.0 29.12.2012
    General release
    1. Added: StripedSet, StripedMap - hash set and hash map 
        implementation based on fine-grained lock-striping technique
    2. Added: CuckooSet, CuckooMap - implementation of cuckoo hashing algorithm
        based on fine-grained lock-striping technique
    3. Added: SkipListSet, SkipListMap - implementation of lock-free skip list
    4. Added: template <typename... Args> emplace(Args&&... args) member function 
        for all containers in cds::container namespace. This function is available 
        only if the compiler supports new C++11 features - variadic
        templates and move semantics.
    5. Changed: lambda functions are used internally instead of wrapping functors.
        If the compiler does not support C++11 lambdas the old-style wrapping functors are used.
    6. Changed: test projects has been splitted for optimizing compile time.
    7. Breaking change: class cds::lock::Auto has been renamed to cds::lock::scoped_lock,
        class cds::lock::AutoUnlock has been removed
    8. Added: support for MinGW (tested with TDM-GCC 64bit, gcc 4.7)
    
1.2.0 20.08.2012 (beta)
    General release
    1. Added: MichaelDeque - deque lock-free algo discovered by Maged Michael
    2. Added: BasketQueue - Michael's queue modification discovered by Nir Shavit et al.
    3. Added: support of Clang 3.0, 3.1 compiler (tested on Linux with boost 1.49)
    4. Fixed: solving problem of 8-byte atomic data alignment on 32-bit platforms
    5. Fixed bug 3536393: OptimisticQueue core dump 

1.1.0 17.04.2012 (beta)
    General release
    1. Added: C++11 atomic operations support. The library has been rewritten
        for using std::atomic class and operations proposed in C++11 Standard.
        If the compiler does not support the standard <atomic> library, 
        own partial implementation declared in cds/cxx11_atomic.h is used. 
        cxx11_atomic.h contains implementation for lock-free part of C++11 
        <atomic> header needed for libcds.
    2. Added: support for C++11 feature (if applicable):
       - inline namespace (for GCC 4.4+)
       - function =default and =delete specifiers (for GCC 4.4+)
    3. Changed: the main reclamation cycle ("liberate" function) of cds::gc::PTB 
       memory reclamation schema has been optimized. Previous implementation
       could lead to unbounded memory consumption under high contention.
    4. Changed: the internal structure of cds::intrusive::OptimisticQueue is greatly simplified. 
       The interface of the class is slightly changed.
    5. Fixed: some problem with cds::gc::HRC memory reclamation schema that
       could be the cause of occasional program crash.
    6. Fixed: an error in node reclamation algo in queue implementation (MSQueue, MoirQueue, 
       OptimisticQueue). As an result of the error, some items could be lost with memory leaks.
    7. Changed: cds::concept namespace and its content has been removed
    8. Added support for Microsoft Visual C++ 11 Beta
    9. Added support for GCC 4.7
    
1.0.0  31.12.2011 (beta)
    This version is completely rewritten to support intrusive version of lock-free containers
    and more lightweight garbage collectors interface.
    The class hierarchy and interfaces have been completely reimplemented from scratch.

    1. Added: intrusive containers. Many lock-free containers in libcds have the intrusive
       counterparts. The library is fully refactored to support intrusive containers.
       Class hierarchy is changed: almost all non-intrusive container classes are based 
       on their intrusive versions.
       Two new namespace is added:
        cds::intrusive - for intrusive containers
        cds::container - for non-intrusive containers
       Namespaces by container type (cds::queue, cds::map and so on) have been removed.
    2. Added: New option-based approach is used for class declaration instead
       old traits-based one. This approach allows to declare template arguments
       in position-independent manner that is very useful for complex template declarations.
       Option-based declarations use C++0x variadic templates if compiler supports it (GCC),
       otherwise (MS VC) an emulation is used.
    3. Changed: garbage collectors interface is generalized. cds::gc::GC (where GC is
       one of HP, HRC, PTB) classes has been added.
    4. Removed: tagged pointer GC. This GC
       - unsafe for complex data structure
       - x86-specific since it requires double-width CAS primitive
       - memory-consuming since it requires separate free-list for each type stored in the containers
    5. Default threading model is changed (see doc for cds::threading namespace):
       - for Windows and MSVC++, CDS_THREADING_WIN_TLS is the default now
       - for *nix and GCC, CDS_THREADING_PTHREAD is the default now
    6. Added GCC 4.6 support (constexpr)
    7. Added Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (vc10) solution

0.8.0  28.03.2011 (beta)
    1. Added: cds::Initialize and cds::Terminate functions that initializes and frees library's
       internal structures.
    2. Added: cds::memory::michael::Heap - Michael's lock-free allocator
    3. Added: Exponential back-off strategy for spinning
    4. Added: cds::queue::vyukov_mpmc_bounded - bounded queue
       developed by Dmitry Vyukov (http://www.1024cores.net)
    5. Added: support for FreeBSD amd64, x86

0.7.2  27.02.2011 (beta)
    1. [Bug 3157201] Added implementation of threading manager based on Windows TLS API, see
       cds::threading::wintls::Manager. Added CDS_THREADING_WIN_TLS macro. See docs for
       cds::threading namespace for details.
    2. Fixed bug in cds::threading::pthread::Manager: ptb_gc has not been initialized properly.
    3. New function
            template <typename T, typename FUNC>
            bool erase( const key_type& key, T& dest, FUNC func ) ;
       has been added to all map classes.
    4. New function
            template <typename T, typename FUNC>
            bool insert( const key_type& key, T& val, FUNC func ) ;
       has been added to all map classes.
    5. Added new argument "bNew" to functor "func" of map's "ensure" member function:
            void func( VALUE& itemValue, const VALUE& val, bool bNew ) ;
        bNew = true if new item has been added
        bNew = false if key is found
    6. Fixed bug in cds::map::SplitOrderedList: LSB of dummy node's hash should be zero
    7. Changed: thread liveliness checking on *nix has been changed to pthread_kill(id, 0).
    8. Fixed: in map template member functions the functor may be passed by value
       or by reference; use boost::ref( yourFunctor ) to pass your functor by reference
    9. Fixed: cds::gc::tagged GC and all classes based on this GC has been rewritten
       to solve stability problems.

0.7.1  30.12.2010 (beta)
    1. [Bug 3130852] cds::queue::TZCyclicQueue::empty() has been corrected
    2. [Bug 3128161] It seems, GCC 4.4 has a bug in __thread on x86 and x86_64. New "threading model"
       CDS_THREADING_AUTODETECT has been added. See docs of cds::threading namespace for details
    3. Fixed errors in the "Pass-the-Buck" garbage collector (namespace cds::gc::ptb)
    4. [Bug 3128148] The code is aligned with the C++ standard (minor violations has been removed)
    5. [Bug 3141654] missing break statement for atomic store - fixed
    6. Added in-place scan strategy to cds::gc::hzp::GarbageCollector that does not allocate any memory.
    7. Fixed bugs in HRC and tagged GC

0.7.0 05.12.2010 (beta)
    1. Preliminary support for "Pass The Buck" memory manager is added. See cds::gc::ptb namespace.
    2. Many part of library is rewritten to generalize the usage of various GCs
    3. The new class cds::details::aligned_allocator has been added for allocating aligned memory
       blocks. It is useful for Tagged Pointer memory reclamation schema (cds::gc::tagged_gc).
    4. [Break change] New argument has been added to the member functions "ensure" and "find"
       for ordered list and map classes
    5. New member function "emplace" has been added to ordered list and map classes. This member function
       allows change the value (or a part of it) of list/map item.
    6. The internal structure of class cds::map::MichaelHashMap is completely refactored to support
       cds::gc::no_gc correctly
    7. The classes RecursiveSpinT, RecursiveSpin32, RecursiveSpin64, and RecursiveSpin from cds::lock
       namespace have been renamed to ReentrantSpinT, ReentrantSpin32, ReentrantSpin64, and ReentrantSpin
       respectively
    8. Compiler support: GCC version below 4.3.0 is not supported
    9. Fixed memory leak in cds::map::SplitOrderedList
   10. Added compiler barrier to spin-lock release primitive for x86 and amd64
   11. Makefile script is changed to resolve the problem when an user calls 'make clean' directly.
       Thanks to Tamas Lengyel to point me to this bug.
   12. The file dictionary.txt is excluded from distributive. This file is used for testing purposes only.
       You may create dictionary.txt in this way:
        cd ./tests/data
        perl -X split.pl

0.6.0 26.03.2010 (beta)
    1. The library is rewritten using atomic primitives with explicit memory ordering (based on C++
       memory model proposal). The implementation of atomic primitives for supported architectures
       is developed from scratch.
    2. Total refactoring

0.5.0 31.12.2009  (beta)
    First release
